	<p>Buttoned-up junior attorney, Sydney Babcock, has the perfect job with the perfect company, is about to marry the perfect guy 
		and is right on track with her perfectly ordered life.  A last minute assignment takes her from her bridal shower in 
		Michigan straight to exotic, chaotic Los Angeles where she runs smack into a wacky cast of mismatched characters who 
		comprise the remaining "entourage" of a long dead rock star named Eli Trainor.  
</p>
	<p>Sydney's assignment: to locate her company's recently acquired assets, namely the master tapes of Eli Trainor's 
		eagerly anticipated second album.  Only problem is, Eli and the supposed "only masters" went down in a tragic 
		plane crash some thirty years ago.   
</p>
	<p>With the scent of easy profit in the air, it's game on for Sydney as she navigates through the comically unfamiliar 
		territory of ulterior motives, old vendettas and greed.  And the natives here are definitely not as helpful as they seem!
</p>
	<p>The question is, will Sydney find the lost masters or will Eli Trainor and "the music that might have been" always 
		remain an almost perfect rock and roll mystery?
</p>
