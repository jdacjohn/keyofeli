		<p>	Interestingly enough, acting never appealed to Caroline and growing up in a traditional Korean household made it
			 difficult for her to chase her dreams. Though she began her college education in the science field, it quickly
			 changed into the Arts. In addition to her studies at USC, she began studying with award winning director Lauren 
			Patrice Nadler at the NY Advantage. In December 2004, Caroline graduated from USC with a B.A. in Theatre Arts and 
			to further her acting skills, she began studying with Scott Sedita (Fight for Fame). With the help of Sedita, 
			Caroline was able to land her first TV Co-Star role on the sitcom "JOEY" starring Matt LeBlanc and Jennifer Coolidge, 
			which aired October 2005. Soon after she entered into the business professionally, landing an agent & also Toyota & 
			PSA commercials. Some other hit TV shows she has been on: "<strong>Grey's Anatomy", "Sons of Anarchy", "ER", The Unit", 
			"iCarly"</strong> & the popular daytime soap <strong>"The Young and the Restless"</strong>. You can catch her later this year in the indie 
			feature <strong>"Marriage Retreat"</strong>.</p>
